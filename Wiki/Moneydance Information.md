# Information about Moneydance

The Infinite Kind (developers of Moneydance) has provided a developer kit that allows users to develop their own extensions in Java.  This kit comprises a set of jar files containing the definition of all packages,classes,fields and methods available and a set of html pages listing the details of those entries.  The amount of information available in these pages ranges from a bare listing of the definition of the code to description on how to use it.

In this Wiki is information to supplement those pages.  It has been gleaned from example code provided by other authors, the various forums and reverse engineering through trial and error.

Please use as you see fit.  The best way to determine how things work is to try it out.  If you have access to an IDE such as Eclipse you can inspect the various objects within Moneydance as your code executes. It is sensible to create a copy of your data file and try out your changes on that copy.

The following information is available:
