# Background Information about Moneydance

There is a reasonable user manual available for Moneydance [(download page)](http://infinitekind.com/help).  It describes how to do things.  What it doesn't do is explain how Moneydance works under the covers.  Here I have started to compile some information that has been gleaned from writing extensions.

The following topics are available:

* [Accounts](Accounts Information)
* [Transactions](Transaction Information)
* [Budgets](Budget Information)
* [Loans and Reminders](Loans and Reminders)
