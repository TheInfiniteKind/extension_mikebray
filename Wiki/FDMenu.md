Before you can see any data you need to select the data you want.  Each of the check boxes (1) identifies the type of data you wish to display.  Clicking on the ones you want and then click on the **Generate** button (3).

For Transactions (2) you can display them either by account which will only work when you have selected an account in the Tree, or by File which displays all tranactions.  No matter which way you display transactions only those with a date within the range selected will be displayed.

If you choose to display transactions by **File** you can display them at any time.

Once you have made your selections click on **Generate** (3) to load the data into the [tree](FDTree)
