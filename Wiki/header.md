# Enter Values - Budget Header

The header part of the Enter Values window allows you to define the overall budget. The budget will run from the Start Date to the End Date.  This does not have to be a full year but it can not be longer than a year.  Year 2  is one year from the End Date and year 3 one year from year 2.  The screen is shown below:
