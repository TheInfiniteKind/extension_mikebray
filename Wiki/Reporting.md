# Welcome

Welcome to the wiki for the Moneydance Reporting Utility

## What does the utility do

The utility is not an extension on its own but a generic tool used by other extensions to display and print reports.

The utility is used in the following reports:

* Budget Report

## Use

All reports are displayed in a standard format:

The standard fields are:

1. A report title
2. A report sub-title
3. A filename identifier
4. The Print and Close buttons

In Moneydance all reports are scaled to fit one page wide.  If the data is too large for a width, the font is scalled down.  With this utility it will first create the report pages using the standard size font.  This could be many pages wide and many pages deep.  **This utility uses the Printing Font selected in MD Preferences page.**

When you click on **Print** the  utility asks the user to select a printer.  At this point you should choose the orientation for the report using the printer properties.  When you click on OK/Print the utility will ask you to select the number of pages for the width.  The following is displayed:

Select the width of the report and click on OK.  The report will be generated and sent to the printer.
