Before you can use this extension you need to create your budgets within Moneydance.  Use Tools->Budget Manager and create a new entry with the appropriate period type.  **Note:** do not choose **Mixed** as this the 'old' style Budget and is not supported by this extension.

Start the extension and you will see this window:

If you have more than one budget click on the Budget drop down (1) and select the appropriate budget.

If no budget exists or you wish to add a new one click on '+' (2).  You will be presented with this screen:

This is the same as the Moneydance Add Budget screen.

The parameters will be read from the named file(3).  If you wish to use a different file click on the search button (4) and select the file you want.  Files with this extension have two extensions: BPEX for expense categories and BPIC for income.  Do not enter the extension in field (2).

Click on **Enter Expense Values** (5) or **Enter Income Values** (6).  Click on **Close** (7) to leave the extension
