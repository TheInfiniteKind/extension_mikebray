Welcome to the wiki for the Moneydance Quote Loader Extension. This extension has been built to help users overcome the issues created by the closing down of the Yahoo Finance API and the throttling of the Alpha Advantage free service. The extension is a collaboration between myself (Mike Bray), the developer of the hleofxquotes standalone program and Derek Kent.

**With the changes to security by The Infinite Kind the author of hleofxquotes has withdrawn support.  I personally would like to thank him for his hard work in making this extension what it is.**

**Please note: This extension uses 'screen scraping' to capture the prices, i.e it mimics a user and copies the price from the web page.  The two sources, FT.com and Yahoo.com provide the prices for free as long as you are using the data for your own personal use.  Should they change their policies this extension may stop working.  Please do not use the data obtained from this extension for commercial gain.**

**PLEASE READ [THIS](https://bitbucket.org/mikerb/moneydance-2019/wiki/How Quote Loader Works) ABOUT HOW QUOTE LOADER WORKS BEFORE USING BUILD 3025 OR LATER.**

To use select Quote Loader from the extensions menu.

## Warning
There is no guarantee that the Quote Loader system will continue to operate. Factors outside the developers' control may change and the system will be unable to return quotes. Userâ€™s should be aware of this warning and only use the free Quote Loader system based on the acceptance of this possibility.

You use this extension at your own risk.  I am not part of The Infinite Kind support and I am providing this extension for free.  Support is on an 'As Available' basis.

## What does the extension do

The extension displays all of your securities that have holdings.  You can also choose to display securities that do not have holdings (include Zero Accounts) and/or currencies (Process Currencies). 

Note: Securities with no holdings and Currencies will only be displayed if they have the 'Show on Summary Page' option ticked.

The extension then allows you to download the current prices for the displayed securities/currencies. To do this you need to select which source you wish to use for each line.  The extension will attempt to retrieve a price for each security/currency from the selected source.

## Start

When you start the extension you will see a screen similar to this:

![quoteloadlabel3025.jpg](https://bitbucket.org/repo/9p4r4rA/images/1915284606-quoteloadlabel3025.jpg)

The screen is in three sections:

1. The run options and the selection criteria
2. The actual securities/currencies with the options for obtaining a price
3. The control buttons

These are described on the following pages:

* [Run Options](https://bitbucket.org/mikerb/moneydance-2019/wiki/Quote Loader Run Options)
* [Selection Criteria](https://bitbucket.org/mikerb/moneydance-2019/wiki/Quote Loader Selection Criteria )
