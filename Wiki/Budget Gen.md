# Welcome

Welcome to the wiki for the Moneydance Budget Generator Extension

## What does the extension do

The 'new' format for budgets within Moneydance can be set up with one of four periods:

* Weekly - The budget has an entry for each week with the week starting on Monday 
* Bi-weekly - The budget has an entry for each fortnight where the first Monday in the calendar year is the start of the first fornnight
* Monthly - The budget has an entry for each calendar month, i.e the 1st to 28th/29th/30th/31st depending on the month
* Annual - The budget has an entry for each year,i.e the 1st Jan to 31st Dec.

To add values to the budget you have to type a value into each period for each expense category.  You can copy periods but the entry of a complete year of budget values can take some time.

This extension overcomes this by allowing you to enter the type of expense/income for each category and then generate the individual budget period entries.  In addition it allows you to see a complete year of budget entries and update them in a single table.

It can have any number of parameter files, each with a different set of categories.  Expense categories are managed separately from Income categories.
