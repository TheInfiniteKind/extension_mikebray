## Data Table

The Data Table shows the individual fields of  the record, for example:

Certain fields have been blanked for privacy reasons.

You can scroll down the table to show all fields available.

**Note** If you are viewing an Account and you have selected 'View Transactions By Account' you can click on the **View Transactions** button and the transactions for that account will be displayed (see [Transactions](FDTrans)).  This will not display the other side of the transaction.  You need to select **VIew by File** to see both sides of the transaction.
