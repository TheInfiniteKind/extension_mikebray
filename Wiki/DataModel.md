# The Moneydance data model

The Moneydance data is accessed via the various classes.  It is relational in the sense of certain data items are accessed via another item, for example to gain access to a 'Budget Item' you need to first access the Budget List, select a Budget from that list and then access the Budget Items belonging to that Budget.

Look at [Data Model Object Model] to see an Object Model of the data.
