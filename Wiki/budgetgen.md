# Welcome

Welcome to the wiki for the Moneydance Budget Generator Extension

## What does the extension do

The 'new' format for budgets within Moneydance can be set up with one of four periods:

* Weekly - The budget has an entry for each week with the week starting on Monday 
* Bi-weekly - The budget has an entry for each fortnight where the first Monday in the calendar year is the start of the first fornnight
* Monthly - The budget has an entry for each calendar month, i.e the 1st to 28th/29th/30th/31st depending on the month
* Annual - The budget has an entry for each year,i.e the 1st Jan to 31st Dec.

To add values to the budget you have to type a value into each period for each expense category.  You can copy periods but the entry of a complete year of budget values can take some time.

This extension overcomes this by allowing you to enter the type of expense for each category and then generating the individual budget period entries.

## Installation
